Once upon a time, there came into being a universe. 
Searingly hot, it swarmed with elementary particles. 
Among its fields was a Higgs field, initially switched off.
But as the universe expanded and cooled, the Higgs field suddenly switched on, developing a nonzero strength.
When this happened, many fields became stiff, and as a result their particles acquired resonant frequencies and mass.
Thatâ€™s how the universe was transformed, through the influence of the Higgs field, into the quantum musical instrument it is today.
